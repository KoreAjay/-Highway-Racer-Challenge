🚗 Highway Racer Challenge

A fast-paced, top-down 2D racing game built entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Challenge yourself to stay on the road in this winding, infinite highway-style track!

✨ Features

Top-Down 2D Racing: Classic arcade racing action.

Highway Style: The car remains centered while the track scrolls around it, giving the feeling of a long, high-speed drive.

Responsive Controls: Seamless playability on both mobile devices (using dedicated touch buttons) and laptops/desktops (using keyboard input).

Realistic Drag: Experience reduced speed and heavy friction when driving off the road (onto the green area).

Performance Metrics: Real-time display of speed (in km/h) and elapsed race time.

Single-File Build: The entire game is contained in one index.html file, making it extremely easy to host and share.

🕹️ How to Play

The goal is to drive the car around the closed circuit, maintaining speed while staying on the gray road to avoid friction and slow down.
